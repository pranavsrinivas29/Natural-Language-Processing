# Natural-Language-Processing

## Task in NLP.
### Input : Text files
### Pre-processing of the text files for the segmentation checks before performing the annotation. Once segmentation is done, Named entity recognition and Parts of speech tagging is made. This annotation is done by using spaCy Library.
### spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing.

### Named-entity recognition is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

### In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.

### Output: Annotated Text Files

### NLP_Knowledge Graphs1.ipynb: Different NLP techniques are carried out on the text file, such as Tokenization, Lemmatization, POS Tagging,Dependency Parsing, NER Tagging

### NLP_Ambiguities.ipynb: Lexical ambiguities and Word Sense Disambuiguation (WSD).
